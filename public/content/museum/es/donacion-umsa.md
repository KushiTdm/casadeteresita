# A Legacy of Education and Medicine

In 1937, Don José María Gamarra made a transformative donation to the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés (UMSA): the land in the Miraflores area for the construction of the Faculty of Medicine and related departments.

## A Family Connected to Medicine

Years later, his son Juan (Teresita's husband) graduated from this very medical school before continuing his specialization in the United States. Juan would become a distinguished surgeon in La Paz and a professor at the same institution his father helped create.

## The Parchment of Gratitude

Many years after the donation, when Juan had established himself as a notable surgeon and professor, Don José María decided that the university's parchment of gratitude should be preserved by his son. This parchment, a symbol of the family's commitment to education and public service, is now on display here.

## A Beautiful Friendship: The Story of Mauricio Aira

### Parallel History of Silver and Coca, but also of Coca and Gold

*By Mauricio Aira*

A delightful article by Humberto Vacaflor, describing almost poetically the old rivalry between silver and coca, brought to mind a cherished memory of the Coca King, José María Gamarra—father of the physician Juan Gamarra who operated on my feet to correct a congenital malformation.

#### An Unexpected Bond

After being operated at the American Clinic in Obrajes, I formed a relationship with Don José María because we were placed in the same hospital room. While recovering from minor surgery, he had the time and patience to tell me about his then-honorable title of "El Rey de la Coca" (The Coca King).

#### The Gold Necklace

Showing me a gleaming necklace made of gold nuggets of various sizes, he focused on one particular piece. "This is the largest nugget," he said, approximately three centimeters long and perhaps one or more centimeters wide, "the biggest ever found in Los Yungas. We discovered it among the coca plantations when we were drying the leaves at the foot of Huayna Potosí."

This majestic mountain of the Andes range, he explained, is where gold is born—flowing rather selfishly, little by little, throughout the course of the waters.

#### A Friendship Built on Admiration

A sincere friendship emerged between us. On my part, it was admiration for the example of work and effort he had exercised throughout an entire lifetime.

"Today there isn't a single cocani (coca leaf seller) who doesn't sell my product. The coca I produce is everywhere," he told me. We're talking about 1957, still far from the cocaine boom that hit Bolivia starting in 1975 during the Bánzer Government. In truth, 98% of coca was used for traditional acullico (chewing), and the paceña variety was the most sought after—if not the only one.

#### Coca, Silver, and Gold

Indeed, Humberto, the parallelism of coca with silver is historical, mysterious, and deeply meaningful—but also with gold, as you can see. Without doubt, you've encountered Yungas producers who occasionally find gold nuggets. The natural, spontaneous, and enriching alloy occurs.

#### An Invitation to Remember

Don José María invited me to his home. "When you reach Plaza del Estudiante, look at the Sucre monument—in the direction his sword points, you'll find my house without getting lost."

Indeed, I was there, and he told me curious stories about coca that I reserve for another time. Among us, although for only a few minutes, was Juan Gamarra, the physician whom I never had the opportunity to thank because he operated on me for free—it was his own initiative.

Thanks to Juan Gamarra, I was able to walk with straight feet, the abnormality corrected by the reduction of the calcaneus bones. And thanks to his father, the Coca King Don José María Gamarra, I was able to learn the first stories of the coca leaf.

## Historical Significance

This parchment represents more than gratitude—it symbolizes the interconnection of education, medicine, family legacy, and social contribution that defined the Gamarra family's impact on Bolivian society. The medical school built on this donated land has trained generations of Bolivian physicians, continuing Don José María's vision of serving the community.
