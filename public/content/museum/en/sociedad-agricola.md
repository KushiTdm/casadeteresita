# The Coca King and the Agricultural Revolution

José María Gamarra Gutierrez, father-in-law of Teresita, played a monumental role in developing Los Yungas region of La Paz during the first half of the 20th century.

## A Business Empire in the Andes

Before the agrarian reform of 1953, the Industrial Agricultural Society "José María Gamarra S.A" became **the most important agricultural company in Bolivia**, owning 30 productive farms primarily located in the Nor Yungas provinces.

### Infrastructure Legacy

The Society's contributions transformed the region:

- **Roads**: Construction of critical transportation routes throughout the Yungas provinces
- **Healthcare**: Establishment of a hospital in Coripata
- **Sports**: Built the José María Gamarra Stadium (later renamed "Ramiro Castillo Stadium" in honor of a renowned Bolivian soccer player born in the region)

### Agricultural Innovation

The Society introduced groundbreaking improvements to Bolivian agriculture:

#### The Guayaquil Banana
First-class quality bananas from Ecuador, known as "Plátano Guayaquil," were introduced to Bolivia for the first time through plantings imported from Ecuador.

#### Coffee Excellence
Significant contributions to improving coffee cultivation methods and quality throughout the region.

#### The Coca King
The Society's greatest impact came from producing exceptional quality coca leaves. As the **principal producer in what was essentially an oligopoly**, Don José María earned the title **"El Rey de la Coca"** (The Coca King).

## Economic Cornerstone

The Society became the **primary source of tax revenue** for the La Paz department budget, thanks to coca leaf taxation. It's crucial to note that during this era, drug trafficking didn't exist—coca consumption was exclusively for traditional and medicinal purposes, deeply rooted in Andean culture.

## Historical Context

This exhibition piece represents a pivotal chapter in Bolivian economic history, showcasing how agricultural innovation and entrepreneurship shaped the development of an entire region before the transformative agrarian reforms of the 1950s.
